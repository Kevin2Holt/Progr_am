A pet project that has been put on the back-burner (perhaps forever)

Just a simple website where people can create event programs / iteneraries instead of printing masses of paper copies. Could be used for announcements / info.

This hasn't made it past the proof-of-concept phase where I was just defining how event info would be stored / fomatted and then reading that data and displaying it on the page.
